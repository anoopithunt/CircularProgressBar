# CircularProgressBar
CircularProgressBar is a custom SwiftUI view that displays a circular progress bar. It is designed to be used in iOS or macOS apps to show progress towards a specific task or goal.The progress bar is drawn as a circular shape that can be customized with different colors, stroke widths, and animations.

The view uses a combination of SwiftUI's built-in animation features and custom animatable modifiers to provide a smooth, customizable progress bar that can be updated in real-time as the task progresses. The progress bar can also be set to start and stop automatically, without the need for user input.

CircularProgressBar is available as an open-source project on GitHub. The repository contains the source code for the view, along with an example project that demonstrates how to use it in a real-world app. The project is actively maintained by the community, with regular updates and bug fixes.
